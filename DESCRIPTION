Package: htmltab
Title: Assemble data frames from HTML tables
Version: 0.5.0
Authors@R: "Christian Rubba <christian.rubba@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: htmltab is a package for extracting structured information from
    HTML tables. It is similar to readHTMLTable() of the XML package but provides
    two major advantages. First, the package automatically expands row and
    column spans in the header and body cells. Second, users are given more
    control over the identification of header and body rows which will end up
    in the R table. Additionally, the function preprocesses table code, removes
    unneeded parts and so helps to alleviate the need of tedious post-processing.
